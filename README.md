# **DSA Case Study – Group 12 (BSCPE 2-4)**  

Welcome to our **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Case Study** project! This website explores **seven key case studies**, each demonstrating different **data structures and algorithms** through interactive implementations.  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project was built as part of our **DSA case study presentation**, combining both **design** and **development** to create an engaging and educational experience.  

### **💡 Case Studies Covered:**  
- **Tic Tac Toe** – Game logic using Minimax Algorithm  
- **Stack** – Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) operations  
- **Queue** – First-In-First-Out (FIFO) operations  
- **Binary Tree** – Hierarchical data representation  
- **BST Traversal** – Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversal  
- **Towers of Hanoi** – Recursive problem-solving  
- **Sorting Algorithms** – Various sorting techniques (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)  

## **🎨 Design & Development**  

### **🖌️ UI/UX Design**  
The website follows a **Minecraft-inspired theme**, designed in **Figma** to ensure a **blocky, pixelated aesthetic** while keeping navigation intuitive and user-friendly.  

### **🛠️ Tech Stack**  
- **React.js** – Component-based structure for efficient UI rendering  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling for a clean, responsive design  
- **HTML & JavaScript** – Core structure and interactive functionality
